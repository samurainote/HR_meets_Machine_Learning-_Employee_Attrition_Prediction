## Introduction

#### Machine Learning in Human Resources
I think HR is one of the Hottest Business Domain for application of Machine Learning techniques.

Since retirement analysis is performed on existing employees, not only attribute data that can be understood from resumes in hiring, but also transaction data such as trends in overtime work and experience values ​​for dealing with projects and problems are effective. Not only personal attributes (education, family structure, evaluation), but also superior's attribute information and department's attributes (department sales and total number of people) etc. are valid.

A decrease in human resources means a gradual decrease in employees over time. In general, relatively Recruiting is a problem for companies. Human resources often play a leading role in designing corporate compensation programs, workplace cultures, and motivation systems that help organizations maintain good employees.
